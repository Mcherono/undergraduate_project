# Life Insurance Uptake Among Kenyan Youth

A logistic regression analysis identifying factors that contribute to low life insurance uptake among youths aged 18–24 in Kenya.

## Overview

Life insurance penetration in Kenya remains low at around 1.3% of the population. This project investigates the key barriers to uptake among university students, using survey data collected at Karatina University (n=352).

Three factors were examined:
- Negative perception towards life insurance
- Low level of awareness about insurance products
- Low income level of parents/sponsors

## Key Findings

- Negative perception is the strongest barrier
- Low awareness significantly increases the likelihood of non-uptake
- Income level alone does not explain low uptake among youths

Overall model accuracy: 64.8%

## How to Run
